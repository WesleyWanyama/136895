"The use of all data is subject to the Terms and Conditions of use for WHO data compilations, aggregations, evaluations and analyses. By using the Datasets or any presentations of data derived from them, you agree to be bound by and adhere to these Terms and Conditions, as may be amended from time to time by WHO at its sole discretion. If any datasets are credited to a source other than WHO, then those materials are not covered by these Terms and Conditions, and permission should be sought from the source. Please acknowledge the use of these datasets by including the following reference in your publications: WHO, Malaria Threats Map, year, date of access, acknowledgement of the countries having provided the underlying data (in the event that the source refers to ministries of health or national malaria control programs of specific countries). Please note that not every contributor has allowed us to share their data. Hence some of the data in Malaria Threats Map is not available for download. For data extracted from publications, please note that when the values of relevant variables were not directly provided in the publications or were analyzed differently than recommended by WHO, values were calculated from the reported data. WHO has made a best effort to geolocate all the studies for which coordinate were not provided or wrong coordinates were provided. However, precise coordinates could not always be found. Hence the coordinates  provided in this datasets often correspond to the closest location that could be found, i.e the center of the village or district."
